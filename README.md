# Conway's Life Game

A simple Conway's Game of Life implementation with a focus on interactive speed control and grid manipulation.

## Features
- **Speed Control**: Numeric keys 1-9 for 1x to 9x speed.
- **Interactive Grid**: Randomize or set custom density.
- **UI Interaction**: Toggle UI with `H`, reset with `R`, and more.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
```bash
python evolution_demo.py
```

## Controls
- `Space`: Pause/Resume
- `R`: Reset grid
- `D`: Default density (immediate)
- `H`: Toggle UI visibility
- `1-9`: Set evolution speed (1x to 9x)
- `+/-`: Adjust speed incrementally
- `Mouse Wheel`: Zoom in/out
- `Arrow Keys`: Fine-tune density/speed
